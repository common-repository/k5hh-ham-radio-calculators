Simple ham radio calculators with shortcode.

== Description ==

I'm creating a series of calculators in service to amateur radio operation.

First is the Dipole length calculator. This calculator is built using the formulas I found at http://www.hamuniverse.com/easydipole.html . If you wish, use them for figuring out this math for yourself.

= Features =
The dipole calculator allows your website visitors to find the resonant length of their dipole antennas on the second raise.

= *** Disclaimer *** =
The K5HH Antenna Calculators are for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect actual numbers for your equipment. I have, in good faith, given my best efforts to provide a calculator that will save ham operators time in setting up their antennas. However, ultimate responsibility for the proper use of your equipment lies with you.
